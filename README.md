# üéì Learning Machine Learning with Python
This repo is made mainly to follow my journey in machine learning using Python. Learning how to use all the packages and make sure eveyrthing is working right. There will be no data synthetisation, only fitting and predictions. For the synthetisation part it is mainly private sorry but the pacakge that I am using is [SDV](https://sdv.dev/). It is a really interesting pacakge and  I suggest you learn more avout the subject. 

There will be different folders in this repository. It is for organization sake and for myself to understand all small details of the different packages and what they do.

## ü§î Purpose
The purpose of this whole study is to for my report. The main idea is to compare the usefulness of synthetic data in prediction and machine learning. I'd like to see if we are able to create fake data that as statistical significance in the model will it be able to improve it. The idea of create the most accurate model in order to predict new molecules activity would be ground breaking. Using SDV for example would be part of the QSAR methodology/journey thus empowering our ability to predict with high accuracy the activity of our future molecules. 

## üêæ First Steps Folder
Here we will be able to trace down all the learnings using mainly Jupyter Notebooks. I will try the Keras library to start my learning journey. 

I will use data from my QSAR project but I will have to remake the whole "generate descriptors from SMILES" maybe using mordred and open babel or using other tools such as KNIME and RDkit.

Maybe staying in the field of descriptors is still a bit hard with a lot of steps. I was able to understand the first steps of Neural Network but the new one is still in developpment. It will be hard to play around with it, without the right focus it will be harder. But for now I will try with other datasets and try other machine learning techniques such as KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbourh).
